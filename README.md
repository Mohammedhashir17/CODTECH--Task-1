# CODTECH-Task--1

Name: MD HASHIR A J

Company: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

ID: CT4DA4207

Domain: Data Analytics

Duration: July to August 2024

Objective:
  The objective of this Python code is to build a simple linear regression model to predict an employee's salary based on their years of experience.

Technologies Used:
  * Python: The code is written in Python programming language.
  * NumPy: Used for numerical computations and array manipulation.
  * Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
  * Matplotlib: Used for data visualization.
  * Scikit-learn: Used for machine learning algorithms, including linear regression.
    
Activities:
  1.Import Libraries: The necessary libraries are imported for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
  2.Import Dataset: The code loads the 'Salary_Data.csv' dataset containing salary and experience data.
  3.Data Preparation:
    The features (years of experience) are stored in the variable X.
    The target variable (salary) is stored in the variable y.
    The data is split into training and test sets (70% for training, 30% for testing).
    Note: The code includes a commented out section for feature scaling (using StandardScaler). This is typically done to normalize the data for better model performance, but it's not necessary in this case as the features are already on a similar scale.
  4.Model Training:
    A LinearRegression model is initialized and trained on the training data using the fit() method.
  5.Prediction:
    The trained model predicts the salary for the test set using the predict() method.
  6.Visualization:
    The training and test set results are visualized using scatter plots and a regression line.

In summary, this code performs the following steps for building a simple linear regression model:

* Loads the data.
* Prepares the data for model training.
* Trains a linear regression model.
* Predicts salaries for the test set.
* Visualizes the results to understand the model's performance.
